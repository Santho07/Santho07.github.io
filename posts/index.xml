[&amp;#39;hello&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;world&amp;#39;].join(&amp;#39; &amp;#39;).tap { |message| message.upcase } # &amp;#34;hello world&amp;#34; As we can see, tap doesn&amp;rsquo;t return its result.

Add the following line in your ~/.pryrc file to enable the rails prompt provided by pry-rails gem.</description></item></channel></rss>
