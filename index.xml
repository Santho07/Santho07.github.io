In this post, I will show how to customize pry for more productivity.
If you are not using pry yet, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to start using pry with rails console. We can add the following gem in our Gemfile and run bundle install.
group :development, :test do gem &amp;#39;pry-rails&amp;#39; end Now, it will open pry whenever we open rails console.</description></item><item><title>Hi there üëã</title><link>https://www.imamhossain.me/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.imamhossain.me/about/</guid><description>Thanks for visiting my blog.
